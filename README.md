SWCVisualization

SWCVisualization is a package designed to facilitate virtual interaction with experimentally reconstructed morphologies documented in the standard SWC file format (i.e. neuromorpho).

Originally this package was written to aid the construction of biologically realistic neural models for use in computational studies of extracellular electrical stimulation but it can be used for diverse neural modeling problems.

Installation
Download the package and while in root directory call: 
```
python setup.py install
```

The latest version of swcVisualization will always be available through Github.

Usage

```
#import modules
from swcVisualization import swcVisualizer
import os


```
